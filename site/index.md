# Lastcomm.it

Lastcomm.it is a tool to check last commit date of a list of GitHub repositories.

* Type `lastcomm.it/YourSecretIdYourTheOnlyOneToKnow` in the address bar, or use the "Create" button a the top-right corner of this page.
* Use your secret URL to edit your list later.
* Set a custom public URL which will display your list in read-only mode.

Lastcomm.it is free software, and code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/guilro/last-commit).

## Futur plans

* display badges present in README.md files (such as travis-ci, code coverage, etc.)
* expand support for GitLab
